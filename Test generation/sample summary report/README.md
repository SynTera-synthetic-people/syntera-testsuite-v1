# Sample Summary Report

Place a sample **summary report** (e.g. PDF or text) here to show the format of “report output” that gets captured for each reconstructed question.

## What we capture

When you run **Market Research Reverse Engineering**, the app extracts for each question:

- **Report Reference** – e.g. “Figure 4: Factors leading to stickiness”, “Page 11”
- **Expected Output Pattern** – e.g. “Bar chart showing 45% prefer X”, “Pie chart by segment”

These are combined into the **Report output** column in the downloaded **Questionnaire CSV**, so each question is linked to the part of the summary report (chart, finding, percentage) it came from.

## CSV columns

- **Q No.** – Question number (only on the first row per question)
- **Question Description** – Survey question text
- **Options** – Answer options (one per row for multi-option questions)
- **Report output** – Findings from the summary report (report reference + expected output pattern)

You can add your own sample report file here (e.g. `sample_report.pdf` or `sample_report.txt`) to keep a reference format.
